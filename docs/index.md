- Practical assignments are to be completed individually or in pairs, as indicated in each assignment description. Each of the course blocks will have one or more practical assignments. The assignments in the first block contribute 30% to the final grade, the second block assignments contribute 50%, and the third block assignments contribute 20%.
- Attendance in practical sessions is mandatory. Roll call will be taken in each in-person session. A maximum of 1 unexcused absence is allowed. If a student accumulates more unexcused absences than the allowed limit, they will not be able to pass the practical component of the course in the C2 examination. However, they will have the opportunity to pass it in the C4.
